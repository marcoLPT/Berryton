Drive your airton AC unit from mqtt with an ESP32 module flashed with tasmota and this berry script

discussion here : 

https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/discussions/17328
other solutions to drive the ac unit cooked by pingus will soon appear.

the purpose is to be able to drive the airton units (that are most likely tcl clones) with an esp32 hooked to the serial port of the A/C unit.

the functionalities targeted for now are : 

- Setting the mode (Fan, dry , heat etc etc)
- Setting the fan speed (low medium high etc etc
- Setting the louvres Height or oscillation

As not being a coder (this is my first published project), the code quality is likely to be poor , but the initial functionalities are working.

the initial functionality is working, while first running the script, wait 1 to 2 minutes for the script to recover the ac unit status to give correct feedback on mqtt.

i run this script with a M5stack atom ESP32 , mind that you need a bidirectional level shifter since the signals sent by the AC unit is in 5V.
there is a lot of discussions on the internet to know if ESP32 is or is not 5V tolerant. For now i run without level shifter and it still works after 1 year.


comments are welcome with pictures and data to see how poor is the regulation yet :-), feedback  might or might not come depending on my time.


modbus crc snippet from  https://github.com/peepshow-21/ns-flash/blob/master/berry/nxpanel.be


in heating mode an offset is implemented (TemperatureSetpointOffset). this offset is meant to be transparent from the homeassistant point of view.
The offset is just here to ensure a correct regulation while you regulate from an external thermostat, since the AC unit temperature sensor is sensing a much higher temperature at 2m height + its enclosed inside the ac unit.
The offset is added to the setpoint you send to the unit , then when reading the feedback from the AC unit, its substracted, to give a correct feedback to homeassistant.

the default offset is 8Â°C which seems to work well for a 30 m2 room.
bigger rooms might require a higher offset.
You will see 2 different behavior of the unit :

- the unit reached its internal setpoints and interrupts by itself: the louvres will remain open , on the highest position
- the external setpoint is reached : homeassistant will give a stop command , the louvres will close, and the red stop button will lit on the A/C unit.
you have to make your experience to see what offset to be given for a maximum temperature stability on your room.

Associated homeassistant configuration to append in your configuration.yaml of homeassistant

note that the thermostat topic is coming from elsewhere
